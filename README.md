## This notebook focuses on Dashboard Development using the Python Dash framework in combination with Plotly for creating interactive visualizations. The objective is to build a functional, single-page application that allows a user to explore the Iris dataset dynamically. The layout is defined with three dynamic charts: a scatter plot, a box plot, and a histogram. It includes Python functions called callbacks that link user inputs from dropdown menus (for selecting features) to the corresponding chart outputs. The final deliverable is a fully functional web application providing actionable insights through interactive data exploration.
